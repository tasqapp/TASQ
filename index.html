<h1>TASQ App</h1>
<div>
<p> TASQ App is a Task Organizer app to help all individuals manage their busy days and busy lives! We have added features <br>
  to our app that makes it easy to use and convienent for our users. Click the button below to read a brief introduction to our app <br>
  and all of its features. We have also included some references to other Task management apps that helped us generate ideas for TASQ! </p>

    <p>TASQ is designed to provide its users with a digitized to-do list - a list that allows the addition, management, and deletion of tasks that the users <br>
    want to keep track of. When it comes to managing tasks, the app emphasizes both agility and simplicity, while also providing users with the option to <br>
    customize and edit their tasks more extensively. TASQ provides the users with a convenient user interface that lets an individual view all their tasks <br>
    for the current day, week, and even month, with each individual view having its own distinct layout. </p>

    <p>TASQ comes with several features that range over a wide span of categories. First, the application features multiple screens (fragments) - ones <br>
    for displaying current data, as well as screens for data creation and modification. Next, a navigation menu which allows the user to easily move <br>
    between the different parts of the app. TASQ also comes with database and remote server support for maintaining user logins and keeping track of <br>
    the application’s users. Alongside its core features, TASQ supports voice commands for the purpose of task addition and page navigation, as well <br>
    as Google Maps for geographically tracking tasks. Finally, the application has sounds incorporated into some of its different parts. </p>

    <p>Summary of app analysis:</p>
    <p>In general, we noticed a few deficiencies that similar apps have in common. Those apps are often too complicated in their approach to customizability,
    making it difficult to create or manage tasks at a fast pace. Some, on the other hand, do not give users the option to customize their tasks enough,
    which we found to be inconvenient in many cases. TASQ aims to work around those issues, and provide the user with a balance between simplicity and
    thoroughness when it comes to managing one’s tasks. </p>
  </div>
  </div>
  <div>
    <p>Our finished app has a large list of features to help our users be capable of easily organizing their tasks. Each feature was decided upon prior to beginning <br>
    implementation and we only included features that we felt were necessary to the ease of use and functionality of the app. The point of the features of our app <br>
    are simply to make the user's life easier! Click the button below to see all of our finalized features! </p>

      <h2>Future Work</h2>
      <p>
          By continuing to work on TASQ we could continue to refine the UI and features that we have. One improvement we could make is implementing full task <br>
          syncing across devices, expanding on our use of a database. By doing so we could improve the user experience when using the app.

  <p> Our app was built over the course of a month and a half and was broken up into five development checkpoints. Before we started implementing <br>
  TASQ, we planned out what we would like to have completed at each stage of development in order to stay on track for deployment. Click the button <br>
  below to see a complete breakdown of what we were able to accomplish in each "checkpoint"!</p>
<button id = "evolution" type="button" class="buttonStyle">Evolution of our App</button>
</div>
<div id="evolutionmodal" class="modal">
  <div class = "modal-content">
    <h2>Evolution of App:</h2>
    <h3>Checkpoint 1:</h3>
    <p>For the 1st checkpoint we designed all of the screens for the app in xml and set up proper navigation between all screens. We designed <br>
        each screen as a fragment and each screen has a toolbar across the top containing a search icon and a slideout menu as well as a title that <br>
        changes based on which page you are on. We also created a slideout menu that slides in from the left side of the screen and displays all page <br>
        options to navigate to: Daily, Weekly, Monthly. We also implemented all of our navigation between screens via the slideout menu. When a user <br>
        clicks on a view option in the menu, they are then taken to the corresponding screen. </p>
    <h3>Checkpoint 2:</h3>
    <p>For this checkpoint, we began the implementation of task addition. At this point, a user was able to access the add/edit fragment from any desired screen, <br>
        and add a task to their set of tasks, while also being able to modify some of the fields for a task. We also were able to successfully update the monthly <br>
        screen with the addition of a new task.</p>
    <h3>Checkpoint 3:</h3>
    <p>For this checkpoint, we accomplished the proper addition of tasks on the Daily screen. We also  added more extensive functionality to the monthly screen <br>
        to include the display of all tasks for the day the user selects on the calendar. At this point in the project, each individual task on the daily screen can <br>
        be modified in terms of its attributes, with the changes being immediately applied and updated when the user hits submit. </p>
    <h3>Checkpoint 4:</h3>
    <p>For this checkpoint, we accomplished the proper completion of tasks on the Daily and Monthly screens. We also added task sorting based on the priority assigned <br>
        to the tasks by the user. Additionally, we added checkboxes and sounds to each individual task on the daily screen so tasks could now be completed. We also <br>
        added database functionality using Firebase and login and registration screens to the application.</p>
    <h3>Checkpoint 5:</h3>
    <p>For this checkpoint, we have finished our entire implementation of TASQ. We added basic voice command functionality, which allows the user to trigger voice <br>
        commands and ask the app to navigate its menus with voice commands. Additionally, we added Google Maps support to the application, which allows the user to <br>
        associate tasks with locations by adding addresses to a task that the user is creating/modifying. Alongside the big implementations, we touched up and fixed <br>
        smaller portions of the application to finalize its performance for the current version. </p>

  <p> Although we are happy with the work we put into TASQ and the app that we published, there is always more work than can be done! Click the button below <br>
