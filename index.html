<h2>Evolution of App:</h2>
<h3>Checkpoint 1:</h3>
<p>For the 1st checkpoint we designed all of the screens for the app in xml and set up proper navigation between all screens. We designed 
    each screen as a fragment and each screen has a toolbar across the top containing a search icon and a slideout menu as well as a title that 
    changes based on which page you are on. We also created a slideout menu that slides in from the left side of the screen and displays all page 
    options to navigate to: Daily, Weekly, Monthly. We also implemented all of our navigation between screens via the slideout menu. When a user 
    clicks on a view option in the menu, they are then taken to the corresponding screen. <p>  
<h3>Checkpoint 2:</h3>
<p>For this checkpoint, we began the implementation of task addition. At this point, a user was able to access the add/edit fragment from any desired screen, 
    and add a task to their set of tasks, while also being able to modify some of the fields for a task. We also were able to successfully update the monthly 
    screen with the addition of a new task.<p>
<h3>Checkpoint 3:</h3>
<p>For this checkpoint, we accomplished the proper addition of tasks on the Daily screen. We also  added more extensive functionality to the monthly screen 
    to include the display of all tasks for the day the user selects on the calendar. At this point in the project, each individual task on the daily screen can 
    be modified in terms of its attributes, with the changes being immediately applied and updated when the user hits submit. <p>
<h3>Checkpoint 4:</h3>
<p>For this checkpoint, we accomplished the proper completion of tasks on the Daily and Monthly screens. We also added task sorting based on the priority assigned 
    to the tasks by the user. Additionally, we added checkboxes and sounds to each individual task on the daily screen so tasks could now be completed. We also 
    added database functionality using Firebase and login and registration screens to the application.<p>
<h3>Checkpoint 5:</h3>
<p>For this checkpoint, we have finished our entire implementation of TASQ. We added basic voice command functionality, which allows the user to trigger voice 
    commands and ask the app to navigate its menus with voice commands. Additionally, we added Google Maps support to the application, which allows the user to 
    associate tasks with locations by adding addresses to a task that the user is creating/modifying. Alongside the big implementations, we touched up and fixed 
    smaller portions of the application to finalize its performance for the current version. <p>
